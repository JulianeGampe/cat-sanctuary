## UX

### Colour Scheme 

As a first step a color extractor has been used to extract colors from the choosen background image.

![Color Extractor](documentation/screenshots/colorextracttheme.png)

The lighter color #f2f2f2 has been used in a color palette tool to find the main font color #5a374a. 
To make sure it contrasts well against the background image it was tested in a contrast checker both with the lighter and with the darker color extracted from the background image. 

![Contrast light background color](documentation/screenshots/lightbackgroundcontrastcheck5a374a.png)
![Contrast dark background color](documentation/screenshots/darkbackgroundcontrastcheck5a374a.png)


The lighter color #f2f2f2 was used as background color on the other pages and also as font color in the navigation menu and footer.

The third color #886276 was choosen to fit the color scheme. It is used for the supportus button as well as in the navigation hover and form button hover. It was as well checked in a contrast checker against #f2f2f2.

### Typography 

Google fonts has been used to find the two fonts that are displayed on the website. For the headings this is Yaldevi, which is described has a narrow font intended for titles and short texts. For the body the font Roboto is used, which is a common pairing with Yaldevi.

To provide visual cues font-awesome icons have been used in the navigation bar.
- a house icon for the home page
- a cat icon for the ourcats page
- a medical kit icon for the support us page
- a map icon for the wheretofindus page

The links to the social media platforms in the footer are represented with the equivalent icon as well.

### Wireframes

Wireframes created with Balsamiq were used to plan the layout of the website.

- The project is responsive and functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.

- The navigation, home page, our cats page, support us page, where to find us page and the footer are readable and easy to understand.

- The support us form works and requires a name, email and the selection of one radio button. Comments are optional. The email field requires and email address. The submit and reset buttons are working.

- All colors have been tested with a contrast checker, as can be seen in the color scheme section above. 

  - As the light purple background-color #998f7f that was intially used for the hover of navigation, supportus, submit and resetbutton failed the contrast test, the color #886276 was used instead. This color passes the contrast test with the white color #f2f2f2 that is used as font color in the hover state.

### Solved Bugs

- The footer was pushed too far down on the home page and on smaller screensizes it was not pushed down enough on the where to find us page.
- This was solved by applying a grid structure to the navigation, main content and footer.
- navigation and footer were set to auto, while the main content was set to 1fr to push the footer down, even if there is not sufficent content
- additionally the size of the background image on the home page was set from 100vh to 100% to allow the footer to appear at the bottom when using a larger screensize

## Deployment
