## UX

### Colour Scheme 

As a first step a color extractor has been used to extract colors from the choosen background image.

![Color Extractor](documentation/screenshots/colorextracttheme.PNG)

The lighter color #f2f2f2 has been used in a color palette tool to find the main font color #5a374a. 
To make sure it contrasts well against the background image it was tested in a contrast checker both with the lighter and with the darker color extracted from the background image. 

![Contrast light background color](documentation/screenshots/lightbackgroundcontrastcheck5a374a.PNG)
![Contrast dark background color](documentation/screenshots/darkbackgroundcontrastcheck5a374a.PNG)


The lighter color #f2f2f2 was used as background color on the other pages and also as font color in the navigation menu and footer.

The third color #886276 was choosen to fit the color scheme. It is used for the supportus button as well as in the navigation hover and form button hover. It was as well checked in a contrast checker against #f2f2f2.

### Typography 

Google fonts has been used to find the two fonts that are displayed on the website. For the headings this is Yaldevi, which is described has a narrow font intended for titles and short texts. For the body the font Roboto is used, which is a common pairing with Yaldevi.

To provide visual cues font-awesome icons have been used in the navigation bar.
- a house icon for the home page
- a cat icon for the ourcats page
- a medical kit icon for the support us page
- a map icon for the wheretofindus page

The links to the social media platforms in the footer are represented with the equivalent icon as well.

### Wireframes

Wireframes created with Balsamiq were used to plan the layout of the website.

- All colors have been tested with a contrast checker, as can be seen in the color scheme section above.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
